Project contains 3 componments:

1 GUI app for students who can submit their problems to the database
1 Console app which will fetch the data and can be used by faculty to keep track of issues.
Additional parameters such as 'Resolved' and 'Comments' in the database will allow for this app to expand and faculty would be able to use it as a response system.
All changes are pushed onto a mysql database which is queried in the application itself.
